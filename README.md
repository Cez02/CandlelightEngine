# Candlelight Engine

## Introduction

As a little passion project of mine, the Candlelight Engine will serve me the purpose of studying game engine development and architecture. Additionally it'll help me understand 3D graphics rendering and other aspects of low-level game development.

## Technologies

The technology I'm planning to use is OpenGL and C++ (pretty standard for these types of projects).
